<h2 class="nobreak">THE STAR JEWELS</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time there was a little mermaid
who lived down at the bottom of the sea in a
cave of pink coral. Her cheeks were as pink
as the coral itself; her teeth were like a row
of the pearls which hung around her neck;
and her hair—which was very long and
wavy—was as green as the greenest seaweed
you ever saw. And though green hair sounds
strange to us, it was accounted a mermaid’s
greatest beauty. Her name was Wavilocks.
Also she had instead of two rosy feet a funny
little scaly tail with which she steered herself
through the water. She was a famous swimmer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>Wavilocks was a pretty little mermaid, and
old Triton, her father, doted upon her and
spoiled her, as foolish papas sometimes do. He
gave his little daughter everything that she
wanted,—everything in the wide ocean which
a sea-child could wish. She had her own little
coral playroom, with its toys of shell and
sponge; and her pets among the fishes and curious
ocean creatures. She had a living flower-garden
of beautiful sea anemones, pink and
purple, yellow and red. She had a little chariot
all her own, in which to ride about the sea,
like the grown-up ocean folk. It was of pinky,
pearl-lined shell, most beautiful, and it was
drawn by a span of sea-horses, the sweetest
little fellows in the whole kingdom of Neptune.</p>

<p>She had also the prettiest things for her
toilet,—golden combs, with which to comb
her long green hair, mirrors of polished pearl,
and fans of coral, scarves of silky seaweed, and
ornaments of shell. But the thing of which
she was most proud was the beautiful necklace
of pearls which her father had given her.
All the mermaids wore lovely necklaces, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
Wavilocks had the most beautiful of any.
Old Triton, who knew every cave and corner
of the sea, had scoured and scraped the ocean
treasuries to find the finest pearls for his little
daughter. She wore always about her neck a
long rope of them, wound around and around,
such as the Sea Queen herself could not match.
Some of the pearls were as big as kernels of
corn; some were as big as grapes; and a few
were like hen’s eggs, as large and smooth,
and twice as white as the whitest. Nobody
ever saw such pearls as Wavilocks wore about
her neck every day of her life. The sea-mothers
found fault with doting old Triton, and said
he had no business to let a little mermaid wear
such gorgeous jewels. But when he told Wavilocks
of this, she chuckled and said that they
were jealous because they had no such jewels
themselves. She may have been partly right
about this, but they were right too in what
they said.</p>

<p>Now you would think that Wavilocks must
have been contented and happy in her lovely
home, where she had everything that a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
mermaid could wish. And she was happy so
long as she could have her own way. But
there came a time when she could not have
her own way, and then she grew sulky and
discontented. For days and days she moped
in her coral playroom, and nothing that poor
old Triton could do made her smile.</p>

<p>What do you suppose she wanted? She had
happened to sit up one night later than a little
young mermaid should, and she had seen the
diamond stars twinkling in the sky. She wanted
them for a necklace! She declared that she
<i>must</i> have them for a necklace. She was tired
of her beautiful rope of pearls, and vowed that
she would not wear it any more unless she
could have the starry one to wear with it.
This made poor Triton very unhappy, for he
had taken great pride in his beautiful gift to
his little daughter, but now she cared nothing
at all for it, and demanded something which
he could not give her.</p>

<p>The naughty little mermaid teased and wept
and refused to be good. “I shall cry always,
always, until I have those lovely stars. Boo-hoo!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span> 
she sobbed. Her father was at his wit’s
end. He worried and worried because it would
be dreadful to have Wavilocks always crying
for something which he could not give her.
He worried until his green hair began to turn
white, and his poor old eyes looked as wild as
those of a cuttle-fish. Then he said to himself:</p>

<p>“I will go to King Neptune and see whether
he can help me or no. Perhaps he will tell me
how I can get the stars from the sky for Wavilocks,
for I am sure I do not know.”</p>

<p>That very night Triton went to the King’s
beautiful palace in the deepest, greenest part
of the sea, and told him how his little daughter
needed a starry necklace which he could not
get for her. And he begged the Sea King to
tell him what must be done. But Neptune
looked very stern.</p>

<p>“Tell your child,” he said, pulling his sea-green
beard, which waved to and fro in the
water, “tell her that she is an ungrateful
daughter, and that I forbid her to think any
longer of the far-off jewels. Already she has
the most beautiful necklace in the sea,—such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
a one as not even my Queen can match. A
starry necklace is fit only for the Sky Queen
to wear. No other may possess those wonderful
jewels. There are fair enough gems in the
sea for any mermaid’s use. If she cannot be
content with them she shall be punished.”</p>

<p>Old Triton was alarmed at these words,
for he could not bear to think of his dear daughter
being punished. Very sadly he went home,
and very sadly he told Wavilocks what the
King had said.</p>

<p>“He does not wish me to have the starry
necklace, because the Queen has none,” pouted
the naughty little mermaid. “But I must have
it, I <i>will</i> have it, or I shall cry always and
always.”</p>

<p>Instead of spanking her, as he should have
done, Triton only shook his head and said
sadly,—</p>

<p>“I would gladly give it to you if I might,
dear daughter. But the King has spoken.
The stars are not for you; you must not even
think of them again. Never go out when they
are shining in the sky. Be a good girl, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
to-morrow I will bring you a beautiful new
coral belt, such as no mermaid ever before
wore.”</p>

<p>But Wavilocks sulked and sniffed and declared
that she did not want a coral belt, and
she would not kiss her kind father good-night.
He sighed and went away, poor merman, to
his thinking-place in a rocky cavern.</p>

<p>Now there was one creature who had overheard
the talk between Wavilocks and her
father, and his little eyes gleamed wickedly
at mention of the starry necklace. The Crab
was the most evil of all the sea-creatures, and
old Triton had forbidden Wavilocks ever to
play with him or listen to his words. The sea-folk
hated the Crab because of his mischievousness
and because of his wicked history.
He had not always been the sneaking nuisance
of the sea. Once, long before, he had
lived in the sky. He was a cousin of the great
Sky Crab, the guardian of the star jewels, and
once he too had helped to take care of them.
But because he had tried to steal a few for
his own use, the big Sky Crab had indignantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
cast him out of heaven, down to the
lowest depths of the sea. Oh, yes, the Crab
knew all about the stars which Wavilocks so
longed to own!</p>

<p>Wavilocks had never been told this story,
but she knew that she must never have anything
to do with the ugly, crawling fellow.
And so, when she heard his harsh voice close
beside her cradle, she ought not to have
listened.</p>

<p>“Hist!” said the voice. “Hist!”</p>

<p>Wavilocks knew who it was, and she knew
that sly whisper meant mischief. She herself
was feeling very naughty.</p>

<p>“What is it, Crab?” she whispered.</p>

<p>“I have accidentally overheard what you
were saying to Master Triton,” he hissed,
“and I do not blame you at all. The King
is wrong. You, fairest Mermaid, ought to
wear the starry necklace,—it is your right.
The jewels are said to be even more beautiful
when closely seen. But they are hardly fair
enough for you!”</p>

<p>So spoke the wicked old Crab with a flattering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
tongue. Wavilocks was pleased. “I
should like to see them closely,” she said.</p>

<p>“One could climb up there, I think,” said
the Crab slyly.</p>

<p>“Oh, how? Tell me how it can be done,
dear Crab?” cried Wavilocks eagerly. The
Crab winked one eye.</p>

<p>“There is a silver staircase that leads up to
the moon. Sometimes one can see it, sometimes
not. To-night it is very bright. The
moon is a round silver doorway through which
streams light, and beyond it is a beautiful
land where my cousin, the Sky Crab, lives and
has charge of the star jewels. I have always
wanted to go up there and see him, but I do
not care to go alone. If I could find some one
to go with me—” The Crab stopped and
sighed.</p>

<p>“Oh, how I should like to go with you,
Crab!” exclaimed Wavilocks, sitting up on
the edge of her cradle. “But my father and
the King have forbidden me even to think of
the starry jewels.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” whispered the Crab. “Come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
with me to-night, and for my sake my cousin
will give you all the stars you wish.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I dare not go!” sighed Wavilocks.
“The King will punish me for disobeying
him.”</p>

<p>“Pooh!” snorted the Crab. “He would
never know. Let us go this very night. I
long to see my dear cousin. I can scarcely
wait another minute!” (What a wicked story
that was!)</p>

<p>Wavilocks slipped out of her cradle. “I
can hardly wait another minute to have those
star jewels!” she cried. “Yes, I will go.
Come then, wise Crab, and show me the way.”</p>

<p>“I will take you upon my back,” said the
Crab. “We shall travel faster so, since you
have no feet for climbing.”</p>

<p>Wavilocks seated herself upon his broad
shell, and away he crawled, the wicked fellow,
very stealthily, so as not to be seen by the
grown-up sea people, and especially by old
Triton.</p>

<p>Up and up they went until they came to
the surface of the sea, where the big silver<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
moon was shining upon the water, glorious
and bright.</p>

<p>“Look where the flight of silver stairs
comes down to the sea,” said the Crab, pointing
with his claw. “We will climb up there,
Wavilocks, and pay a visit to my dear cousin.
How glad he will be to see us!” And he
chuckled wickedly to think how he was going
to repay the Big Crab for having turned him
out of the sky.</p>

<p>Out to the bright spot upon the water where
the silver moonbeam staircase touched the sea
crept the Crab, with Wavilocks upon his back.
And no one saw them go. They reached the
foot of the stairs and began to climb,—up
and up, step by step, while the little mermaid’s
green hair streamed out behind. Her
long pearl necklace she used as a bridle, and
so she drove her strange steed up the steep
way, until they reached the silver gateway of
the moon. The door was open, and from the
wonderful sky-land beyond the light streamed
out, so that Wavilocks was dazzled. But she
was even more dazzled when they had passed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
through the gateway and came out upon the
wide sky floor, where burned and flashed, with
a thousand rainbow colors, the five-pointed star jewels
which she had seen shining from afar.</p>

<p>“Oh, the beautiful diamond stars!” cried
Wavilocks. “Let us make haste to find your
cousin, the Big Crab, that he may give us
some for my necklace.”</p>

<p>But the Crab winked his eye. “We need
not wait for that,” he said. “My cousin loves
me so well that I am sure of his generosity to
you. Let us pick all we wish first, and then we
will go to him. But hist! We must be very
quiet about it, or the other sky-people will
learn what is being done, and will be jealous.”</p>

<p>The two set eagerly to work, gathering up
the jewels which lay sprinkled over the velvet
sky-carpet like daisies in a meadow. The Crab
gathered them star by star with his clumsy claw,
as one would pick berries. Wavilocks scooped
the five-pointed stars by handfuls, and poured
them into the great conch shell which she had
brought for the purpose, until it was brimming
over with rainbow flashes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>“Oh, what a wonderful necklace I shall
have,—grander than any one ever saw before!”
cried the greedy little mermaid.</p>

<p>“Oh, how angry the old Crab will be when
he sees how we have robbed his treasure!”
chuckled her wicked companion to himself;
and they went to work even faster than before.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a loud noise behind
them.</p>

<p>“Wooh! Hooh!” cried a terrible voice.
“Robbers, wretched robbers, what are you
doing with my jewels?”</p>

<p>Wavilocks screamed and the Sea Crab gave
a snort of fear. There behind them was the
Big Crab, sprawling his enormous ugly shape
among the stars. His great claws were snapping
viciously, and his goggle eyes were glaring
at the pair, as he crawled nearer and
nearer.</p>

<p>“It is the Crab!” gasped Wavilocks’ companion.
“I am lost!” and away he scuttled
as fast as his claws would take him, while the
little mermaid clung to his back as well as she
could, for he had quite forgotten her. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
began a dreadful race to the shining staircase.
The great Sky Crab clattered after them, puffing
and blowing out fire.</p>

<p>“Wicked Sea Crab,” he cried, “so it is
you who again are seeking to rob me of the
precious stars entrusted to my care. You have
come up here from your nasty, moist den in
the sea, to which I tossed you. Moreover, you
have brought this strange sea-creature to help
you steal the jewels. Ah! this time I will
punish you both.”</p>

<p>They could feel the flaming breath of the
Big Crab. It scorched, it sizzled, it melted
the hard shell of the Sea Crab until it became
soft and useless. It crisped the mermaid’s
pretty green hair, which streamed out behind
her in their rapid flight. Wavilocks screamed.
Her awkward steed hissed with terror, dislodging
many stars from their settings as he scrambled
among them. At last they were almost
safe at the head of the staircase, when Wavilocks
felt the great claw of the Big Crab seize
the necklace of pearls which hung about her
neck. Snap! The string broke, and the pearls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
went flying helter-skelter over the sky, scattering
themselves among the stars.</p>

<p>“My necklace, oh, my necklace!” wailed
she, but they could not stop to gather up the
lost pearls.</p>

<p>They had reached the stairs. The Crab
plunged forward, and they tumbled and rolled
and slid down from the sky to the sea, into
which they fell with a great splash. Glad
enough they were to cool their poor scorched
bodies in the wetness. Down, down, they sank
together to the bottom of the ocean, two very
miserable creatures.</p>

<p>Now the Crab had shriveled and shrunk
and become the tiniest, most pitiful little fellow
you ever saw. Moreover he was now quite
helpless and unprotected.</p>

<p>For his hard shell, which had served him as
a shield against his enemies, was now melted
and soft, and was no longer of any use to him.
He was at the mercy of the whole sea, which
was indignant at his new wickedness. Thenceforth
he must slink and hide away wherever
he could, an outcast thief. He became the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
Hermit Crab, whom to-day one finds borrowing
the shells which other tiny creatures have
abandoned, creeping away into dim corners,
and always carrying his home upon his back,
because he is afraid to venture his poor, unprotected
body out of doors.</p>

<p>Neptune decreed that the wicked Crab
needed no other punishment worse than this.
As for Wavilocks, she also had been punished
enough. The beautiful green hair which had
been her pride was scorched into an ugly
brown. Sobbing with shame, she cut it off—all
its splendid length, and tossed it away into
the sea. Sometimes you may find strands of it
nowadays, washed ashore by the tide. Long,
long afterward her green hair grew again; but
for months and years she was laughed at and
teased about her short mop of brown hair,
so unfashionable in the sea-kingdom. A sad
little mermaid she was in those days. For not
only had she lost her wavy locks, but the
lovely rope of pearls was gone forever, scattered
among the jewels of the sky. You can see
some of them to this day if you look hard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
among the flashing stars; bright jewels they
are, but they do not twinkle like the others.
The Big Crab now watches over them also
with his other treasures, and it would have
to be a sly thief indeed who could steal them
back again. Wavilocks must go without any
necklace, although the other mermaids wear
theirs proudly. Yes, she has no necklace at all.
For what do you think became of the stars
which she went so far to steal and had so sad
a time in gathering?</p>

<p>Wavilocks had clung closely to the conch
shell which held her stolen treasure during all
the terrible time of her fall down the silver
staircase. And when she came to the bottom
of the sea she still held it fast. But alas!
When the poor little scorched mermaid came
to look at the stars which she had hoped to
wear about her neck, she found that they had
sadly changed. The shell was full of something
living, something squirming and cold.
One by one she took out the five-pointed stars
which had been so beautiful, and they had
come alive; they were star-fish! The first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
star-fish that had ever been seen in the
ocean.</p>

<p>How Wavilocks screamed when the moist,
writhing feelers touched her hand! So this
was the end of the lovely necklace which she
had hoped to wear so proudly,—a conch shell
full of ugly, wriggling sea-stars. She tossed
them away as far as she could, and fled
sobbing to her poor old father, who tried to
comfort her, and forgot to punish her for disobeying
him.</p>

<p>Poor little sea-stars! One cannot help pitying
them, who used to be the beautiful jewels
of the sky. One sees them sometimes lying
in the pools, red and purple, blue, pink and
yellow; beautiful colors indeed, such as jewels
have, but no longer sparkling and clear, as
once they were. They lie and stare up wistfully
through the green water, up at the sky which
was once their home, up at the other stars of
which they were once the shining brothers.</p>

<p>And it was all the fault of the naughty
little mermaid, who was not wise enough to
know when she was happy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE BALLOON BOY</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Carlo</span> was the brown-skinned boy who stood
on the corner of the Avenue every morning
with a great bunch of red and blue balloons
tied to a stick. Carlo used to wait smiling for
the children to come up with their nurses and
pick out the balloons with which they loved
to play. The balloons bobbed and danced
above Carlo’s head as if they wanted to fly
away. Indeed, one of them once succeeded in
escaping, just after it had been bought by
little Johnny Parker. Johnny had forgotten
to hold it tight, and <i>Pouf!</i> Off it sailed over
the trees. No one ever knew what became of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
that little red balloon, which soared up far beyond
the reach of Johnny’s wailing. But the
other little balloons were always trying to
follow after, and sometimes they pulled so
hard at the strings that they seemed almost
ready to lift Carlo off his feet and bear him
with them over the tree-tops.</p>

<p>Carlo was a happy boy, for he had come
from a happy country where the people still
believe in fairies, and he had not lived in this
land long enough to catch the disease which
makes one believe that there are “no such
things as the Little People.” Carlo was a kind
boy, and he loved the little children who
bought balloons of him and paid their pennies
into his rough, brown hand. Carlo had a little
sister at home in the old country, and when
he had earned money enough by selling red
and blue balloons he meant to send for Nita
to come and live with him, so they could have
a little home of their own.</p>

<p>One morning it rained hard, oh, very hard!
Carlo did not go out to the Avenue, for he
knew that the children would all stay indoors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
that day, playing in their nurseries with their
house toys. But in the afternoon, after dinner-time,
the rain cleared away and the sun came
out, hot and bright and beautiful, so that the
sidewalks were soon as dry as dry. Then Carlo
took his bunch of balloons and trudged to the
corner, where he always stood. For he knew
that all the nurses and all the babies, tired of
being in the house, would soon be hurrying
out for an airing in the Park. And of course
they would need balloons.</p>

<p>Carlo took up his station as usual on the
corner where the Avenue stops short before
the high gates, and wishes it could go on into
the Park. This was where the children looked
to find him every day, and he had never yet
disappointed them.</p>

<p>It was just the hour when the big boys
are let out of school. Carlo had forgotten
this. He did not like big boys. Suddenly—with
a rush and a whoop—a crowd of them
came tearing around the corner from the next
street. They raced up and down the Avenue,
shouting and laughing and full of mischief,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
for they had been shut up all this rainy day
and were glad to be out of doors once more.
As they came running back down the Avenue,
one of them spied Carlo standing on
the corner.</p>

<p>“Hallo! Balloons!” shouted the boy, and
immediately the noisy crowd rushed upon
Carlo and surrounded him.</p>

<p>“Give me a red one!”</p>

<p>“Hi! Blue’s my color!”</p>

<p>“Pass me down a red one, quick, or I’ll
cut the whole string!” But they offered him
no money in exchange. Carlo held back, trying
to defend his balloons from their snatching
fingers. Then one boy cried,—</p>

<p>“Ho! Let’s cut the whole string, anyway,
and see them go!” And quick as a flash, before
Carlo had time to do anything, a sharp
penknife had severed the string above the
stick, and away went forty balloons, sailing
over the trees merrily, glad to be free.</p>

<p>The boys gave a yell and danced up and
down. But some one cried, “Look out!
Here’s a policeman!” and off they scampered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
in every direction, before Carlo fairly knew
what they had done. Yes, there was a policeman,
but he had not seen what had happened,
and already he was turning the corner. Even
if Carlo could catch up with him he could
not speak enough English to tell the man his
troubles. Besides, not even a policeman could
bring back those flying balloons.</p>

<p>Poor Carlo! No customers for him this
day. He looked down at the bare stick in his
hand, and then up to where he could just see
some tiny specks on the blue sky, far, far
away. The balloons were seeking their little
brother who escaped long before. Carlo’s eyes
filled with tears, for he was not a very big
boy, and this was a dreadful thing which had
happened to him. Already the procession of
babies was coming down the Avenue, eager to
buy Carlo’s balloons. But he had nothing to
sell them this afternoon.</p>

<p>Slowly and sadly he turned away and slunk
down a side street toward another entrance to
the Park. But the children wondered what
had become of their balloon boy, who was always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
waiting for them on the corner, smiling
pleasantly.</p>

<p>Carlo wandered into the Park and walked
about the twisting paths, wondering what he
should do. He had no money to buy more
balloons. How could he start out afresh in
business? He had sent his last earnings back
across the water to the little sister in the land
where they still believed in fairies, and she
had saved almost enough to bring her here to
him. But now, what was he to do now? How
buy food and lodging, and especially how
buy more balloons with which to pile up future
pennies?</p>

<p>Carlo wandered about for a long time, thinking
and puzzling, until the shadows began
to lengthen, and it was almost night. Then
he went to a little arbor in the Park, far
from the place where the nurses and children
mostly gathered. It was a spot that he loved,
for it was full of grape-vines, which reminded
him of the beautiful home from which he
had come,—the country where the fairies still
lived. He was very tired and hungry, and he
curled up on a settee in the arbor and went
to sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31-32]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i031">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i031.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">THE LITTLE MAN</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>He must have slept a long time, for when
he woke the Park was quite dark, save
where the electric lights made queer patches
of brightness among the leaves and on the
grass and gravel walks. In the arbor itself
hung a light which made the grape-vine with
its half-ripened clusters look strange but very
beautiful.</p>

<p>Carlo awoke with a start, for he had certainly
felt something touch his knee. Yes! Carlo
looked again, and rubbed his eyes. There at
his knee stood a little man,—a little, thick
man in a queer long gown, with a rope about
his waist,—one of the very same Little Men
of whom his mother had often told him in
the land across the sea!</p>

<p>“What is the matter, Carlo?” asked the
Little Man, in Carlo’s own home language.
And Carlo answered in the same soft tongue:</p>

<p>“The boys have cut my balloons away, and
I have nothing left with which to earn my
living, that I may send money to Nita.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>“That is too bad!” exclaimed the Little
Man. “What can we do about it?”</p>

<p>Carlo stared hard at him, for he had always
wanted to see a Little Man. His hat was tall
and had a broad brim, and on his feet were
sandals. His brown gown clung tight about
him, like the skin upon a russet apple, seeming
ready to burst with the plumpness inside.
His cheeks, too, seemed ready to burst with
laughing, even when Carlo told him the story
of the boys’ wicked deed.</p>

<p>“That is too bad!” he cried again, but not
sadly. “What can we do about it?”</p>

<p>He glanced thoughtfully around the arbor
in which they were sitting. It was a grape
arbor, as I have said, and already the grapes
were beginning to turn red and purple in the
autumn coolness, though some were still green.</p>

<p>“The bad boys will steal them,” said the
Little Man to himself, looking at the grapes.
“They will not bring good to any one, only
stomach-aches.” Carlo wondered what he
could possibly mean. Still the Little Man
stared around the arbor, nodding his head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
slowly up and down, as if making up his mind
about something very important. At last he
turned to Carlo and asked suddenly,—</p>

<p>“Do you know where I came from?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Carlo. “I have been wondering.
You do not seem to belong to this country
at all.”</p>

<p>“I don’t,” said the Little Man. “They
don’t even believe in me here, so they never,
never see me—how could they? The babies
who play over there,”—and he twisted his
thumb toward the fountain and the sand-heap,—“even
if they were to come in here
now, could not see me. For their stupid nurses
have told them that I don’t exist. Perhaps there
might be one or two who still believe; and of
them I should have to be very careful. For I
don’t want to be discovered. But they do not
often come here.”</p>

<p>“I come here often,” said Carlo.</p>

<p>“Of course,” chuckled the Little Man,
“naturally!”</p>

<p>“But how happens it that you are here?”
asked Carlo, eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>“Why, I came with you, to be sure. I am
the Little Man of your father’s house. And
when you left the dear old country over the
sea you brought me with you.” The Little
Man sighed. Carlo sighed too. But quickly
he remembered to be polite. “It was very
good of you to come,” he said.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” answered the Little Man.
“I had to follow. Some of them bring poison
creatures in the fruit which they sell,—tarantulas
and scorpions. Some of them bring
measles, and the evil-eye, and other dreadful
things. But you brought <i>me</i>, and I have
been watching over you ever since. I am
glad you come here every day, so I can live
in this very nice place. Now I am going to
help you.”</p>

<p>Carlo thanked him, but he seemed not to
hear. Nimbly as a squirrel he was climbing
up the vine which draped the arbor with its
leaves and grapes. Presently down he came
again, and in his hand he held a fine bunch of
grapes, purple and red and green.</p>

<p>“It is not stealing,” he said, in a whisper,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
“for this bunch has stopped ripening; I can
tell by signs which a fairy knows. It would
soon wither, and would not even attract the
bad boys. So I will use it for my purposes.
Now, please give me your stick.”</p>

<p>Carlo handed him the shorn stick, wondering.
With a few deft knots the Little Man
tied the bunch of grapes to the handle, where
the balloons used to bob.</p>

<p>“What!” he cried, nodding delightedly,
“There you are! Now of course you must go
to sleep again. I cannot let you see how the
last touches are done.” He tapped Carlo three
times on the forehead. Immediately Carlo’s
eyes began to close, his head nodded, and
before he knew it he was lying on the bench
in the arbor, snoring lustily and forgetting all
his troubles.</p>

<p>Then the Little Man must have done something
very strange and wonderful and marvelous;
though no one saw him, and so no one
knows just what that something was. But
when in the morning Carlo awoke with a start,
a baby in a pink dress stood in the arbor holding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
out a little hand in which was a silver
dime, and he was saying,—</p>

<p>“Please, Boy, give me a <i>green</i> balloon!”</p>

<p>Carlo jumped up and reached for the stick,
which was propped between the bars of the
seat beside him. And what do you think?
The bunch of purple and red and green grapes
seemed to have grown and grown, and swelled
and swelled, until each grape had turned into
a beautiful big balloon of the same color! And
that is why on that particular day Carlo had
some green balloons in his bunch, although the
children had never seen any like them before.
And he sold one to the pink baby, and others
to the other babies who came crowding around
when he went out upon the Avenue, until the
green balloons were all gone. For of course
the babies wanted the unusual kind first. But
after that he sold off the ordinary blue and
red ones, and went home with his pockets full
of dimes, and with nothing more on the end
of his stick than when the bad boys let loose
his bunch of balloons. But now there were no
tears in his eyes—no, indeed!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>Now I do not know just what happened
next. But Carlo always looks smiling and
happy about something. The children buy his
balloons every day, and every night he carries
home a pocketful of silver. Carlo is growing
rich. And now little Nita has come across the
sea to be with him. When the cold weather
comes I daresay the Little Man will go to live
in their house, as he did in their old home in
the land where people still believe in fairies.
But you may be sure that as long as he can he
will stay in the pretty grape-vine arbor. If you
are one of the wise children who believe in
him, perhaps you will see him there yourself,
some day. At any rate, whether you believe
in the Little Man or not, if you go at the right
time you will be sure to see the Balloon Boy,
sitting on the bench and smiling happily at
something, with the bunch of red and blue
balloons bobbing over his head. And if you
pay ten cents you may have a balloon all for
your own, which will tug and tug and will
try to get away, just as little Johnny Parker’s
did.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE GREEN CAP</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time in the far East, where
people live upon rice and tea, a little old
woman dwelt all alone in a tiny hut on the
edge of the forest. The little old woman was
very, very poor; but she was a brave soul, and
so long as there was a little tea in her little
teapot, a little rice in her little rice bucket,
and a little water in her well she would smile
a little smile and say, “Oh, I have enough,
and that is all which any one needs in this
world. I am doing very well indeed.”</p>

<p>But there came an evil time for the poor
little old woman. There was a drought in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
land, and all the wells ran dry. There was a
famine, and no more rice nor tea were to be
had for love or money. One night the little
old woman went about to get her evening
meal and she was very, very hungry. First
she went to draw a dipper of water from the
well. But when she peered down into the
well she saw that it was almost dry.</p>

<p>“Alack!” she cried, “when I have used
this last dipper of water there will be none
left for to-morrow. After that I must go dry.
And how long can I live so?”</p>

<p>Slowly and sadly she went back to the house
and took her little rice bucket down from the
shelf on the wall. But when she opened it she
saw only a few grains of rice scantily covering
the bottom of the bucket.</p>

<p>“Alack!” she cried, “when I have taken
out the handful for my supper there will be
no more left for to-morrow. After that I must
go hungry. And how long can I live so?”</p>

<p>She shook her head mournfully and went to
her little teapot, which hung before the fire.
But when she took off the cover thereof she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
cried again, “Alack and alas! Now even my
tea is gone, and whatever shall I do? There
is but a drop in the pot, and when I have
eaten my supper there will be none left for
the morrow. After that I must go thirsty.
But so I cannot live. Day after to-morrow I
shall die!” And the poor little old woman
shed a tear which almost fell into the teapot to
salt the last drop of tea which remained there.</p>

<p>Now she sat down to her scanty supper and
hesitated to take the first mouthful, for it
would so soon be gone. She gave a sigh and
a groan as she lifted the little teapot to pour
out the last drop of tea, for the little old
woman loved her tea best of all.</p>

<p>Just at that moment there came a knock on
the door, a low-down knock such as a very
little child might reach to give.</p>

<p>“Tap—tap!”</p>

<p>“Come in!” said the little old woman, and
she set down the teapot carefully.</p>

<p>The latch clicked, the door opened, and in
came a queer little creature the size of a child
and walking upright upon two legs; but it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
was not a child. It was a funny little monkey,
with a wee black face and a curled-up handy
tail, and on its head it wore a tiny green cap.</p>

<p>“Ugh!” cried the little old woman, who
did not like monkeys, “Ugh, go away!”</p>

<p>But the monkey skipped briskly across the
floor to the fireplace, and stood there shivering
and holding out its small hands to the blaze
quite as a little child might have done. The
old woman stared at it in surprise. “Bless my
stars, how ugly it is!” she said. “But the
poor thing seems cold. Let it stay and warm
itself if it wishes.”</p>

<p>At these words the monkey turned about
and made a low courtesy to the little old
woman.</p>

<p>“Bless my stars!” said she again, for she
had never seen so remarkable an animal, even
in the land where monkeys were common.</p>

<p>Now the monkey had ceased to shiver, and
it came skipping up to the table where the
old woman sat, ready to eat her supper.</p>

<p>“Ugh! Go away!” cried the little old
woman. “Go away, you ugly creature!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>But the monkey rested its chin upon the
board and looked wistfully at the supper.
“May I not share with you?” it seemed to
say, though it spoke no word, and it put its
little hands out towards the old woman,
beggar-fashion.</p>

<p>“Bless my stars!” cried the old woman
again, “it has the way of a child. But what
an ugly child! Ugh! I cannot bear to have
it near me. Yet—it is hard even for a monkey
to be hungry.” She looked at her scanty
dipper of water, at her little dish of rice, at
her teapot with its drop of tea.</p>

<p>“I have but one dipper of water left, one
handful of rice, one drop of tea,” she said
ruefully. “When these are gone I know not
whence to-morrow’s food will come; yet, little
creature with the hands of a child, you shall
share with me so long as I have a morsel. I
cannot refuse those hands. But do not come
too near, for I love not monkeys.”</p>

<p>Now the monkey seemed to understand
every word the old woman spoke, although it
could not answer in words. It bowed gratefully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
over its clasped hands as the old woman
helped it to half the scanty meal,—half the
dipper of water, half the rice, half a drop
squeezed from the little teapot. The monkey
ate hungrily, and when it had finished patted
its little stomach and grinned happily at the
old woman as if to say, “That was very good!”</p>

<p>“I am glad you are satisfied,” said the old
woman with a sigh; “and now will you begone?
There is nothing more in the house
for guest or for host.”</p>

<p>But the monkey laid its head to one side
upon its little hands and closed its eyes, showing
that it was fain of sleep. Then again it
held out its hands, beseeching the old woman.</p>

<p>“Oho!” said she, “you want to sleep here,
too? Well-a-day! That ever I should have
an ugly monkey napping in my hut! But I
cannot turn a poor creature out into the cold
night. You may stay, but keep as far from
me as maybe, at the other corner of the cottage.
Come, now, let us sleep and try to forget
that to-morrow must be a hungry day.”</p>

<p>So they slept, the old woman on her hard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
little cot and the monkey curled up on the
floor, which was no whit harder. And the
old woman dreamed wonderful and beautiful
dreams.</p>

<p>When it was light she opened her eyes, and
at first she thought she must still be dreaming,
for she had forgotten the happenings of the
last night. There was the monkey with its
little green cap on one side frisking about the
cottage, sweeping the hearth, tidying the corners
and setting things to rights.</p>

<p>“Bless my stars!” cried the little old woman.
At these words the monkey turned, and
with a grin beckoned towards the table, where
dishes were already set out as if for a meal.
Then the old woman remembered what had
happened the evening before. But she remembered
also the empty cupboard, and sighed
wearily.</p>

<p>“Breakfast!” she grumbled; “it is little
breakfast we shall have this day. Did we not
share yestereven the last dipper of water, the
last handful of rice, the last drop of tea?
There will scarcely be any breakfast for me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
this day, and you, who are strong and frisky,
had best seek one elsewhere, leaving me to
die.”</p>

<p>But the monkey shook its head, grinning
knowingly, and still beckoned to the table. It
lifted the dipper and showed how it was still
full of water. It lifted the cover from the
rice dish, and lo! there was a mess of steaming
white rice. It shook the little teapot, and
a drop trickled from the spout.</p>

<p>“Bless my stars!” cried the little old woman,
“last night my eyes must have cheated
me. I certainly thought there was not another
mouthful in the hut. Well, here is indeed a
goodly meal,” and she sat down to the table.
The monkey looked on wistfully, but did not
venture near. Presently the old woman looked
up.</p>

<p>“What!” she cried, “shall you not share,
little guest, you who so cleverly prepared my
breakfast? Did I not say that you should
share so long as I had a morsel upon the
board? Come, then, and eat.”</p>

<p>The monkey grinned happily and drew to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
the table. The scanty meal was sufficient for
them both. When they had finished, the old
woman nodded her head at the monkey and
said,—</p>

<p>“Even a morsel tastes better when one
shares it with company. But little I thought
that a monkey would prove so pleasant a
guest.”</p>

<p>At these words the monkey squirmed with
happiness and frisked about the cottage like a
mad thing. After that it went on with the
household duties, quite like a handy little maid.
But when it had finished these it skipped out
of the door and disappeared into the forest.</p>

<p>“Now it is gone forever,” said the old woman
with a little sigh, “and I shall be left
alone to die of hunger and cold. For even
my store of firewood is gone, and I have not
strength to go to the forest for more.” And
she sat down and cried bitterly, for the poor
old woman’s courage was quite gone.</p>

<p>The daylight dimmed and the night came
on, and the old woman sat rocking herself to
and fro, trying to forget how hungry she was.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
But presently the door burst open and in came
the monkey, staggering with arms full of fagots
for the fire. It made a bright blaze on the
hearth and then came timidly up to the old
woman and laid a hand upon her knee. This
time the old woman did not shrink or cry out,
“Ugh! Go away!” for she seemed no longer
to hate monkeys as once she had done. She
looked up with half a smile and said:</p>

<p>“Ah, you have come back, little guest! I
thought you had deserted me. I know you
think it is supper-time; but nay, there will be
no supper to-night. There is naught in the
house for us to eat, or I would gladly share
it with so willing a helper.”</p>

<p>But the monkey shook its head and drew
the old woman gently by the skirts towards the
door.</p>

<p>“There is no use in going to the well,” said
the old woman; “it is quite dry.” But the
monkey continued to pull her dress, and at last
the old woman rose, shaking her head because
she knew that the quest was useless. The two
went out to the well, and the monkey let down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
the bucket. When it came up the old woman
thrust in the dipper, and lo! she brought it
out full once more with clear, cool, sparkling
water.</p>

<p>“Bless my stars!” she cried in astonishment,
“there is witchcraft here,” and she
looked at the monkey suspiciously. But the
little creature only grinned.</p>

<p>Once more it pulled at her skirts, as though
it would lead her back to the house. Wondering,
the old woman followed, dipper in hand.
The monkey led her straight to where the rice
bucket stood on the shelf. The old woman
shook her head hopelessly as she took down
the bucket, because she knew that it was as
empty as a last year’s bird’s nest. But when
she drew off the cover she nearly dropped it
with surprise. There was still a handful of
rice in the bottom of the bucket.</p>

<p>“Bless my stars!” cried the old woman,
and she looked again at the monkey. But the
monkey only grinned and pointed towards the
teapot.</p>

<p>“That at least I know to be empty,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
the old woman positively, “for I squeezed out
the last drop with my own hand.” But what
was her amazement when she tilted the spout
and out came an amber drop of comfort.</p>

<p>“Bless my stars!” again cried the old
woman. “Here is really enough for another
meal. Witchcraft or no, you have certainly
brought me good luck, little guest, and though
we may die of hunger to-morrow we should
greatly rejoice now, for we thought to be dead,
even this same day.”</p>

<p>So that night passed, and another and still
others. Every morning, as at first, the monkey
prepared breakfast for the little old woman
ere she was awake. And still there remained
a dipperful of water in the well, a handful of
rice in the bucket, and a drop of tea in the
teapot. Every night the old woman found
the same for their supper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55-56]</span></p>
<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i055">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i055.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">THE OLD WOMAN IS SURPRISED</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>She was growing very fond of this queer
little creature who helped her so heartily, and
she wondered how she could ever have disliked
monkey-folk. She even forgot that she had
once thought her guest ugly, for the small face
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>seemed, indeed, to have changed and to have
become more human. The old woman had
made for the monkey a pretty dress of green
to match the green cap which her guest ever
wore upon its head. The long tail which once
she had used as an extra strong hand had
shrunk away and disappeared beneath the
pretty dress; perhaps it was gone altogether—for
the monkey was certainly changing in
many ways, though the poor old woman was
too weak-eyed to see how greatly this was so.</p>

<p>Now the weeks passed, and the months
passed, and it was exactly a year and a day
from the time when the monkey had first appeared.
On that morning the old woman woke
up and saw as usual the little green figure
flitting about the cottage, making things neat
and tidy, and preparing the tiny breakfast
which was always the same,—scanty and
simple, but sufficient for the two, with kindness
and good feeling to eke it out. This
morning, when the old woman was ready to
get up, the busy little creature came skipping
up to the cot. And as it stood looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
down, smiling kindly, the old woman suddenly
blinked and rubbed her eyes.</p>

<p>“Bless my stars!” she cried. “How big
you are! How pretty you have grown! What!
Who is this? You are not my little monkey,
you are a lovely girl smiling at me.”</p>

<p>“Good morning, Mother,” said a sweet voice.
“I am your little guest. I am the same poor
creature whom you took in out of kindness,
and whom you have allowed to dwell with
you this long year, sharing your scanty store.
I owe you more than words can say.”</p>

<p>“Words!” cried the old woman, “and how
long since a monkey could use words?” She
sat staring blankly.</p>

<p>“You see I am really the same,” said the
pretty girl. “I still wear the green dress which
you made for me and the green cap which
I had upon my head when I came to you. In
that green cap lies my secret. I am a Fairy,
Mother.”</p>

<p>Then she told the old woman a strange
story,—how because she was naughty the
Fairy Queen had punished her by giving her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
that ugly monkey-shape, which she must wear
for a year and a day. But at the end of that
time she could take her own shape and go
back to Fairyland. And now the time had
come.</p>

<p>“But you have been so kind to me, dear
Mother, that I may give you one wish before
I go back to my beautiful home,” said the
Fairy maiden.</p>

<p>Then the old woman burst into tears and
flung her arms around the neck of her little
guest. “Oh, do not leave me, kind Fairy-child!”
she said. “I love you very dearly, and
how shall I live without you? I loved you
when I thought you were only a little monkey,
but now I love you a thousand times more.”</p>

<p>Gently the Fairy kissed her and said, “Now
hear what the gift is that I may give you. I
may give you one wish of three, and you shall
choose between them. You shared your simple
food with a poor little animal-guest. Now
for the first wish: Would you live always on
princely fare? If you so choose you may have
more than you need to eat. You may have meats<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
and fruit, fine wheaten bread and choice sweets,
such as are set upon palace tables. You may
have everything that a dainty palate could
desire, and every day a different feast of goodies.
This you may choose, if you so will. Or,
if you think the second choice a better one,
you may become young again as I am now,
for I am a picture of your lost youth which
you have forgotten. You may have health
and strength, and appetite to enjoy life, and
the hearty meals which you will be able to
earn. That is a goodly gift, is it not?”</p>

<p>The old woman nodded, but still her eyes
were unsatisfied.</p>

<p>“Then there is the third choice,” said the
Fairy, and her voice was very soft. “But
that one it seems selfish for me to name, because
it is a wish for my happiness.”</p>

<p>“What is the third wish?” asked the old
woman eagerly.</p>

<p>“You may wish, if you choose—and the
wish will be granted by the Fairy Queen—that
all may remain as it now is; you will be
what you are, a dear old woman living still in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
this little hut, with your little well in which
there will ever be one dipperful of water, no
more; with your little bucket in which there
will ever be one handful of rice, no more;
with your little teapot in which there will ever
be one drop of tea, no more. It is scanty fare
for one, Mother; yet withal, if you would have
one to share it, I will do so still, as I have
done so long. I will become your child—no
longer a Fairy-child, but your little human
girl-child, such as I seem now. I will live
with you always, love you and take care of
you always and share your scanty portion.”</p>

<p>The old woman gave a cry of joy. “But
do <i>you</i> wish it?” she said. “Would you not
rather go back to your beautiful Fairyland,
where you can be happy and care-free always?”</p>

<p>“Nay, dear Mother,” said the Fairy; “if
the choice were mine I would rather remain
here with you than anywhere in the whole
wide world, for I have been very happy here
and I have learned many things. I do not
want to go back to Fairyland to be an idle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
careless, selfish Fairy. I would rather be a
human child and share my mother’s joys and
sorrows. Dear Mother, will you have it so?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will have it so!” cried the old
woman joyfully.</p>

<p>“Think,” said the Fairy, lifting a warning
finger, “think of the fine feasts and the
dainties you might have. Think of the youth
and strength. Would you give up all this for
only me—who must share half the refreshment
from your well, your bucket, and your
teapot?”</p>

<p>“That is enough,” said the old woman.
“What do we need more? We can still
offer a sup to any poor stranger who may
come as you came to my door. Oh, dear
child, if you will stay with me, that is all I
ask!”</p>

<p>“Well, then, let us sit down and have
breakfast,” said the dear little girl, tossing
her green cap into the fire. “Now I am a
Fairy no longer, but your very own little
girl-child. And here is a dipper of water—the
only one left in the well. Here is a dish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
of rice—I used the last handful from the
bucket. Here is just a tiny drop of tea in the
teapot. Oh, Mother, I am so glad!”</p>

<p>So they sat down to their frugal meal, and
they laughed, and they laughed, and they
laughed, they were so happy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">KARL AND THE DRYAD</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was once a lad named Karl who
lived with his father and mother in a little
village of the Flat Land. Karl was a big
fellow, tall and yellow-haired. But all his
strength was in his long, lean body. There
was none in his poor head. Karl was the village
simpleton.</p>

<p>Poor Karl! His life was a sorry one. He
was despised and jeered at by the whole village.
The children followed and tormented
him at every chance, because he could not
learn at school; the grown folk were little
kinder, but nudged one another and made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
jokes about him when he came to the market-place.
Even the cur-dogs followed and
barked at him, but they knew no better. They
were cruel folk, those dwellers in the Flat
Land.</p>

<p>Karl’s own parents were the unkindest of
all. They did not love their son nor pity his
wretchedness, but were ashamed because he
was so simple. They were angry, too, because
in their poverty he could not help them earn
a living. For there seemed little indeed that
poor Karl could learn to do,—he was so very
simple. His parents were continually telling
him how useless he was in this workaday world.</p>

<p>“Oh, you stupid fellow!” they would sometimes
say, driving him out of the house with
blows of broom or stick. “Oh, you great
good-for-nothing, sitting here and eating our
bread without doing aught to pay for it!
Were ever parents troubled with so worthless a
son? Other folk have bright boys and girls
who will grow up to do some good in the
world and be a credit to their parents. But
you will always be a big, overgrown baby for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
us to take care of. Bah! Karl, we are tired of
seeing you about!”</p>

<p>With the tears streaming down his face
poor Karl would shuffle out of the mean little
cottage where they lived, the most unhappy
boy in the whole wide world. There was one
place whither Karl loved to go at such times,
the only place where he was sure of finding
rest and quiet and a friend. In a corner of
the village was a little wood,—a rare sight in
the Flat Land, where trees grew but sparsely.</p>

<p>Few other persons came here, for the folk
of the country cared little about rest or quiet,
and nothing at all for the beauty of nature.
They were quite satisfied with the look of
their clean-shaven country, their smooth lawns
and geometrical canals, their straight, shadeless
roads, curbed neatly on either hand. It
had never occurred to them to plant trees for
beauty and shade, and for the other good
things which trees offer. The little wood had
grown quite by accident, and no one cared
anything about it. But Karl loved the lonely,
pretty place, and especially the great oak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
which grew in the midst thereof, the only
oak in the whole Flat Land. It was so big,
so sturdy, and yet withal so gentle when it
stretched its great limbs protectingly over his
wretchedness, giving the comfort of its shade
and coolness to refresh him in his troubles.
It was Karl’s only friend.</p>

<p>A hot, sultry day came upon the Flat Land,
and it seemed to be Karl’s evil day. In the
morning a rout of children and dogs chased
him through the village, pelting him with bad
eggs and fruit, and with stones, too. They
chased him until the school bell rang, when
he escaped; for Karl did not go to school,—he
was too simple. When he returned home,
breathless, bruised, and weary, scarcely able to
speak from fright and exhaustion, his father
beat him because he could not tell where he
had been all the morning. Poor Karl! There
was no part of the whole town where he had
not been in that dreadful chase. But he had
not the words to explain this to his parents;
so his cruel father punished him, and his
mother drove him out without his dinner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>More wretched than ever before, Karl fled
to his refuge, the little wood, and flung himself
on the greensward beneath the giant oak
tree. He buried his face in the cool, soft moss,
and cried as though his heart would break.</p>

<p>“Poor fool! Poor fool!” he wailed. “Poor
Karl, good for nothing!”</p>

<p>While he lay thus, sobbing aloud and filling
the cups of the moss with his tears, he heard
a heavy tread approaching. Glancing up fearfully,—for
he had no hope to meet a friendly
face, since none in all the world had ever
smiled upon him,—he saw a Farmer approaching
with a great axe over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Hullo, there!” cried the Farmer when he
spied Karl under the tree. “You Simpleton,
better get up. I am going to cut down that
tree which grows over your head.”</p>

<p>“Cut down my tree!” gasped Karl, and he
began to tremble. Was he to lose his only
friend?</p>

<p>“<i>Your</i> tree!” jeered the Farmer. “Poor
Fool, I never knew that you owned anything,
even your senses. The tree is mine, with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
land on which it grows and acres on every
hand. I am going to cut down the tree to
make firewood for next winter. That is all
trees are good for.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do not do that!” begged Karl, spreading
out his arms as if to protect the tree. “I
will not let you cut it down!”</p>

<p>“Ho ho!” laughed the Farmer. “How will
you prevent it, Simpleton? And what is the
tree to you, anyway?”</p>

<p>“The only big tree there is anywhere!”
sobbed Karl. “The only shade; the only safe,
quiet, cool, kind place in the whole world! O
Man, do not cut down the tree! You cannot
make another.”</p>

<p>The Farmer had lifted his axe to strike, but
now he paused and rested it on the ground.
Karl’s last words had struck him with a new
thought. “The Fool speaks a word of wisdom,”
he growled to himself. “It is easier to
cut down a tree like this than to make another.
The acorn which I might plant to-day would
become no such tree in my lifetime—nor in
that of my son, or my grandson, or my great-grandson,
for that matter. Fool, I will think
it over (the more fool I, ’tis likely). I will
spare <i>your</i> tree—ha ha!—for a time. I can
cut it down whenever I like. But as you say,
I cannot soon grow another. My folly bids
yours good-day, Fool.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>Shouldering his axe, the Farmer trudged
half sulkily away. Then Karl fell to sobbing
again, but this time with joy that his tree was
spared. He flung his arm around the great
trunk and pressed his lips against the rough
bark, kissing it again and again. Suddenly
he heard a sharp crack in the oak; another
and another, as if the bark were being ripped
away. He started up in a fright and stood
back from the tree, wondering what was happening
to his old friend.</p>

<p>Presently a long vertical slit appeared in
the side of the tree and grew gradually wider
and wider. A door was opening in the trunk!
Karl stood gazing spell-bound at this amazing
sight, when out from the dark entrance
stepped a figure most wonderful to see. It
was a lovely maiden, dressed all in brown,—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span> 
color of the tree-bark. About her head
was twined a wreath of green oak leaves and
acorns, and in her hand she carried a wand,
made from a branch of the tree. She was
a Dryad, the spirit whose home was the old
oak tree; but Karl was too simple to know
that. He merely stood staring at the beautiful
stranger, too much surprised even to
close his poor foolish mouth, which hung wide
open.</p>

<p>The Dryad smiled sweetly at the lad and
said, “Thanks, kind friend, for saving my tree.
I heard your wise words to the cruel Farmer,
and brave you were to speak them. Now what
can I do to make you happy, as we Dryads
love to make happy him who does kindness
to our sheltering trees?”</p>

<p>Poor Karl did not understand how he had
saved the tree. He only knew that for some
reason the cruel Farmer had changed his mind.
As little did he understand why the Dryad
thanked him. But he heard the kindness of
her voice, and knew she offered aid.</p>

<p>“Oh, can you help me, beautiful Stranger?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
he cried, clasping his hands eagerly and looking
at her with tears in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Indeed, I will help you all I can, kind
lad,” said the Dryad, waving her wand and
taking a step towards him. “Tell me about
your trouble.”</p>

<p>Then Karl told the Dryad all the sorrow of
his life,—how he was foolish and of no use,
a burden to his parents and a disgrace to the
town; how all the village, even the little children
and the cur-dogs, hated and despised
him; how unhappy and lonesome he was.</p>

<p>“O fair Stranger,” said Karl as he finished
the sad little tale, “I am only a poor simpleton,
and I can never do anything good or great.
But if you could only teach me how to do
some little thing that will be of use to the
world, so that I shall not always be hated and
despised even by the little children and dogs
of the village, I should be so very happy!
Will you do this, dear Tree-Maiden?”</p>

<p>The Dryad looked at him pityingly, and the
tears stood in her own brown eyes when she
heard his wish. “Poor boy,” she said, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
her voice was very sweet, “you ask nothing
for yourself, neither riches nor happiness nor
even wisdom. You ask only to be taught how
your simplicity may be of some use to the
world which has treated you so unkindly.
Some would call it a foolish wish. But I say,
O Karl, that it is not foolishness. Twice to-day
you have spoken wisely, lad.”</p>

<p>The Dryad looked up into the tree under
which they stood; she looked down upon the
ground; then she glanced around and about,
thinking hard for Karl’s sake. And at last
she spoke again.</p>

<p>“Remember the words which you spoke to-day
when the Farmer raised his axe. You told
him that he could not make another such tree;
and those words saved this great oak. You
were right, Karl. And he was right when he
agreed that the acorn which he might plant
to-day would not become like this king of
trees in his lifetime, nor in that of his son, or
his grandson, or his great-grandson. Yet the
acorn which you plant will grow, and its shade,
its beauty, its greenness will one day equal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
this. Though you may never see it, the world
will be better for your deed, and future generations
will bless you for it. This shall be
your task, Karl, to fare forth upon a lifelong
pilgrimage and plant as you go the blessed
trees which will shelter the many people who
are to come after you. Thus the Flat Land
will become famous for all time as the place
of happy wayfaring.”</p>

<p>Now poor Karl understood not one word of
all this which the Dryad had so prettily spoken,
save that he was to go away. But this thought
he seized eagerly.</p>

<p>“I am to go away!” he cried. “When,
dear Maiden, and where?”</p>

<p>“You must go to-night,” answered the
Dryad, waving her wand. “See, already the
shadows are falling. You must not be missed
nor sought for this night. You must take with
you only this,—a sack of acorns upon your
shoulders. See where they lie all about us
under the tree, ready for you to gather! And
look! I will take this green mantle which I
wear and make of it a sack to hold your burden.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
Take it, Karl, and fill it thus with the
gift of your old friend, the oak.”</p>

<p>Karl did as she showed him, and presently
he had the long, soft sack filled with brown
acorns. Then the Dryad gave him a lesson in
planting. She showed him how to dig a little
hole for each acorn and cover it with mould;
and though Karl was so simple he learned the
lesson readily, for he had a loving teacher.
Then the Dryad told him how he must walk a
hundred paces from the planting of one acorn
before he turned earth to cover the next.</p>

<p>“Now, Karl, you shall go forth,” she said,
“from village to village wherever your thought
may lead,—for it does not matter,—planting
acorns on either side of the way. And if
any one asks you why you do this, do you tell
him the story of this day; and I warrant you
will need no other pence to pay for food or a
bed whenever you need them. Do not forget
this story, Karl. Do not forget.”</p>

<p>“I am a simpleton,” said Karl humbly,
“yet I shall never forget this day’s happenings,
nor your words to me. But shall I indeed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
be doing something for the world’s good?
I do not see how that can be.”</p>

<p>“Trust me, Karl,” said the Dryad kindly.
“Indeed and indeed, you will be doing much,
I promise you,—more than many men who
call themselves wise. But see, already the
night is falling. It is time that you were starting
upon your journey.”</p>

<p>Thereupon she helped him to place the stout
sack of acorns upon his shoulders, and with a
wave of the wand started him forth upon his
pilgrimage. Smiling with joy to think that at
last he was about to be of some use in the
world, Karl bent his long frame under the
heavy burden, and trudged out of the little
wood. When he reached the highroad, he
turned to wave a last farewell to the Dryad.
But already she had retreated into her tree-cell,
closing the door behind her so tightly
that one would never know where it opened.
It was to his friend the great oak, alone, that
Karl bade his last good-by.</p>

<p>Thus Karl began his pilgrimage with the
green sack of acorns on his back, and with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
neither penny nor crust in his pocket. He began
his pilgrimage at dusk, when every one
was indoors at the evening meal; so no one
thought of him, or spied his doings. With
great glee the simple fellow planted his first
acorn in the heart of the village, just within
sight of the parent oak. So long as light
lasted he trudged on with a happier heart than
he had ever known. He was being of some
use to the world! He did not understand
how, but he believed the gentle Dryad’s promise.
At every hundred paces he planted an
acorn, and he was so busy counting his steps
between whiles that he forgot all his troubles.
And this, too, the wise Dryad had foreseen.</p>

<p>At last, when the way had grown so dim
that Karl could barely see to dig earth for the
last planting, a wayfarer accosted him.</p>

<p>“What ho, Stranger! What are you doing
there?” cried this man.</p>

<p>“I am planting an acorn,” said Karl simply.</p>

<p>“Ho ho! what an idea!” cried the fellow
with a guffaw. “You’ll never live to enjoy
the oak that grows from that acorn. Why do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
you take so much trouble for nothing, my
funny fellow?”</p>

<p>Then Karl told him the whole story, as
the Dryad had bade him do. And when he
paused at the end, the man was silent for a
little time.</p>

<p>“Poor fellow!” he said at last. “Simple,
simple! What a story made of fool’s fancies!
An oak tree—a maiden coming out of it—acorns
to be planted along the road for shade
and rest! Yet—there is something in that
last thought. It might not be a bad thing to
have trees along our highways, though I never
before heard of such a thing. Whew! I know
I should have been glad to-day for the shade
of a tree when I ate my luncheon in the burning
sun.—Have you supped? Where do you
lodge to-night, lad?”</p>

<p>Karl dropped his foolish mouth and said
blankly that he did not know. In truth, he
had never thought of the matter until that
minute. But the stranger clapped him on the
shoulder and said,—</p>

<p>“Come home with me and I will give you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
a bed and a sup. Your wonderful story deserves
so much reward.”</p>

<p>So Karl fared well that night, and on the
morrow once more started happily forth upon
his mission. Thus indeed he fared wherever
he went. At first folk laughed at the story
which he told. But when they came to think
it over, they found it not so ridiculous. Looking
at the poor fool’s eager face and watching
his tireless labor for the good of people
whom he would never see, their hearts smote
them for their own selfishness, and they were
ashamed. They treated him well. Karl never
lacked for a meal or a bed; the telling of his
story always earned either. Yet he never expected
this reward, but was continually wondering
why folk were so good to him. He
thanked them humbly for their charity, and
when he was refreshed, went forth again upon
his pilgrimage with no care for the morrow or
for the next meal. Karl was indeed a simpleton.</p>

<p>The days and the weeks and the years went
by, and Karl still wandered, planting the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
acorns as he went. He never retraced his
steps, but went on and on, down new roads,
new avenues, new boulevards, into new countries.
He never was curious to see how his
work was faring. He was too simple to think
of that. He had been told what he must do
in order to be useful in the world; that was
enough. The Power that watches over little
acorns and great oaks, over simpletons and
wise men, would take care of the work which
Karl had begun.</p>

<p>Mile after mile he traversed, country after
country he visited; the years passed over his
head, silvering his hair and bending still more
his tall frame. As Karl grew older the burden
on his shoulders became lighter to carry; but
very gradually. The sack made from the
Dryad’s mantle must have had magic woven
in its tissue. For that first stock of acorns
from the old oak tree lasted throughout the
entire pilgrimage, during the whole of Karl’s
life, so that he had no need to return to the
unfriendly village for a fresh supply. On and
on he went, and behind him for miles and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
miles through the countries and the years
stretched rows of little oak saplings, of various
heights and sizes, and full of promise,—the
beginning of a wonderful arched avenue. For
after he had passed out of sight, the people of
every village, remembering his strange words
and his wild story, began to think of him as
a holy man, and to look upon the acorns
which he had planted as holy things. So the
sprouts were cherished carefully and more
carefully as the years went by.</p>

<p>Now at last, after many years, Karl was
grown old and feeble, and the acorns were few
in the bottom of the Dryad’s green sack; and
he knew that his pilgrimage was almost over.
He was many, many miles from home, and
for the first time he thought of returning,
longing for the Tree, his friend. He was now
bowed and white-haired. A snowy beard descended
to his waist; his garments were in rags
and his shoes were mere strips of leather bound
around his bare feet. But he was very happy,
for he knew his work was done.</p>

<p>In a little village of the far South country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
he planted the last acorn, and sank upon the
spot, unable to go any farther. The towns-folk
gathered around him, saying, “Who is
this? What holy man is this?” For his face
was indeed that of a blessed saint. Then once
more, for the last time, he told his story. He
told it in a faint and faltering voice, and it
was so sad, so sweet, that every one wept to
hear it, and marveled greatly, saying,—</p>

<p>“Surely, he is indeed a holy man! See,
the green wonder-sack is empty. This is the
end of his pilgrimage. Our village is blest and
shall be famous as the end of his pilgrimage.
We will set up a shrine in his honor where
the last acorn is planted. But first we must
take him home.”</p>

<p>“Yes, take me home!” said Karl, who
understood only this word of all the praise
they gave him.</p>

<p>They laid him on the green mantle and
started gently to carry him where he would
be. He could not tell them the name of the
place, but they traced the way by the acorns
which he had planted and which had sprung<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
up in his honor. As they went from village
to village, folk came out who remembered the
holy pilgrim who had passed erewhile, telling
his quaint story; and they claimed a share in
bearing the blessed burden. So that poor Karl
had a continually growing company of people
ministering to his wants and doing him the
kindnesses of love. But he did not know why,
thinking only that the world was grown wondrously
kind since the days of his boyhood.
As they passed on, the wonder grew at the
length of his pilgrimage and the extent of
Karl’s work. For the journey was not a
matter of days but of months, even at the
steady pace they held. And as they measured
back mile after mile, the planting of Karl became
still more wonderful to see. From little
sprouts the acorns had now grown tiny treelets.
Further on the saplings were waist-high,
shoulder high, above the heads of the tallest.
In lands where he had passed years before grew
rows of tall, beautiful oaks on either side of
the road. But it was when the goodly company
entered at last the Flat Land itself that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
they saw the trees become so sturdy and so
broad that already it was a fair avenue down
which Karl was borne. It was many, many
years since he had passed that way. He himself
was forgotten, but there remained the
tradition of a simple lad who had once gone
by, planting the blessed oaks which were now
the pride of the land. And his own countrymen
joined the company in greater numbers
than any heretofore. For now the wisdom
of the planting began to be seen. The trees
were so tall and so broad-limbed that already
they cast a grateful shade, under which the
pilgrims rested at every stage. Men, women,
and children, even the animals whom they
passed, taking shelter from the summer heat
under these same trees, blessed the wisdom
which had done this thing. But Karl knew
nothing of all this. He only knew that he
was going home; and he slept, being very
weary.</p>

<p>At last they came to the village where Karl
was born; but he did not know it for such, he
was so simple. Nor did the people who flocked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
to praise him remember Karl, he was so
changed. They only knew him for the unnamed
benefactor and friend who had made
their town the fairest and most famous in the
whole land. Among them were the very children,
now grown old like him, who had teased
and tormented him that woeful day. But now
they crowded around the green litter as it was
borne along, seeking to kiss the hand of the
wise man who had given them shade and shelter
on their weary way to and from the market.
The company of pilgrims bore Karl past and
under the trees which had sprung up to mark
his passing from the town. They came to the
last tree, the first which Karl had planted in
the heart of the village on that first day, and
here they paused, troubled. For they said,—</p>

<p>“The avenue ends here. Whither shall we
now carry the holy man, and what would he
have us do? For he has spoken no word since
we began the journey.”</p>

<p>But under this last tree Karl opened his
eyes, and raising himself on his litter stretched
out his arms to the East. Gazing whither he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
pointed, the company saw a little wood, and
rising out of it a single giant oak, greater
than all the others which Karl had planted,—greater
than any which those men had seen.</p>

<p>“There, there!” cried Karl, with joy in his
voice. “Take me there! Home, home!”</p>

<p>Wondering, they bore him to the great oak
and laid him on the greensward beneath the
tree. Then a marvelous thing happened. In
the sight of all the people a little door opened
in the side of the oak, and out stepped a maiden
dressed all in brown, with a girdle of green
and with a crown of oak leaves on her head.
She bore a branch of the tree in her hand,
which she waved gently as she stepped towards
Karl.</p>

<p>“Welcome home!” she cried sweetly, smiling
upon him. “Welcome home, dear friend.
You have had your task and it is ended. Your
wish is fulfilled. You have been of great use
to the world, and it will bless your name more
and more as the years go by. Come, now, and
rest.” Tenderly she took him by the hand,
aiding him to rise. He lifted himself, feebly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
at first, but seeming to gain strength from her
touch. The Dryad wrapped her green mantle
around his shoulders, leading him towards the
oak. And lo! When they reached the little
door, he turned and smiled at the company,
waving his hand in a last farewell, but speaking
no word. And they looked at him amazed,
such a change seemed to have passed over him;
but they could not say how, save that the
weight of years, the weariness, the sorrow, the
yearning, seemed to have slipped away. He
smiled at them, and it was not the smile of a
simpleton, but of one who knew the meaning
of strange things. Then the Dryad drew him
gently after her and they passed in through
the little door, into the heart of the great oak
tree. Noiselessly it closed behind them, leaving
not a crack to show where it had been.
And this was the last ever seen of Karl and
the Dryad.</p>

<p>But the people were left staring at one
another, as folk do when they have seen something
that they cannot understand.</p>

</div>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Katie</span> has been complaining again of the
queer noises in the cellar,” said Rob’s mother,
as she passed the coffee cup to her husband
across the breakfast table.</p>

<p>“It must be rats,” said Rob’s papa. “We
will get a trap.”</p>

<p>“It is very strange,” said Mamma again,
“the girls declare that the noises seem to come
from the old well. That is what all our servants
have said for years. You know some of
them have been so frightened that they gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
us notice, because of the noises in the well.
They think it is bewitched.”</p>

<p>“What is ‘bewitched,’ Mamma?” asked
Rob.</p>

<p>“Pooh, pooh!” said Rob’s papa. “It is only
rats, I know, and the noises do not come from
the well, but from the wall. There must be a
rat’s nest in the wall close by the well. I have
heard about those noises ever since I was a
little boy. Sometimes I used to think that
I heard them myself, and I fancied all sorts
of queer things. But of course it was nothing
but rats.”</p>

<p>Rob had been listening with round eyes,
and now he cried eagerly, “O Papa! I did
not know that there was a well under the
house. How did it come there, and what is it
for?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, there is an old well,” said his papa.
“It has been down there longer than I can remember,
for it is even older than the house,—older
than the city, too, I daresay. It was an
Indian spring, and my great-grandfather built
the house over it, so as to have fresh water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
always conveniently at hand. It is covered now
with a trapdoor, so that no one can fall in by
mistake. That is why you never saw it, Rob.”</p>

<p>“An old Indian spring!” cried Rob excitedly,
“and we drink that very same water
every day! How splendid!” He sipped some
water from his glass and smacked his lips.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said his papa laughing. “This
is ordinary spring water bought at the store.
Our old well has not been used for years and
years. Since the city has been built up so
closely around our house, which was one of the
first ones here on the Hill, we have not dared
to use the well water, because it might not be
clean. I daresay the well is quite dry by this
time. I have not looked into it for years.”</p>

<p>“O Papa! I want to look down into the
well!” cried Rob.</p>

<p>“Well, you shall do so some time,” said his
papa as they rose from the table. “But I am
in a hurry now. Good-by, Mamma. Good-by,
Rob. I will buy a trap on my way down town
to-day, and we will put an end to the noises
in the cellar which trouble Katie.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>Now of course Rob was very anxious to see
that well, for he loved everything that had to
do with Indians. He thought that he could not
wait for his father to show it to him. He ran
into the kitchen and began to bother Katie.</p>

<p>“Katie, Katie,” he begged. “Please come
into the cellar and show me the old well. I
want to look down into it.”</p>

<p>“The Saints preserve us!” cried Katie, lifting
up her hands in horror. “What for do
ye want to be lookin’ into the well? No, me
b’y! It’s I that will be kapin’ away from that
same, and thank ye kindly. ’Tis bewitched it
is, what with the funny little noises a-comin’
out of it day and night.”</p>

<p>“What funny little noises, Katie?” asked
Rob. “Papa says it is rats. He is going to
buy a trap to catch them.”</p>

<p>“Rats! A trap!” sniffed Katie scornfully.
“’Tis no rats at all do be makin’ them quare
little noises. ’Tis bewitched, I tell ye. ’Tis
stark bewitched, that well. And I wouldn’t
go near it at all for the promise of a new
bonnet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>“What does ‘bewitched’ mean, Katie?”
asked Rob again.</p>

<p>Katie wagged her head and mysteriously
made the sign of the cross.</p>

<p>“Oh, who will be tellin’ ye that? If it was
in the owld country I’d say it was Fairies or
maybe the Leprechaun himself. But I never
heard tell o’ Fairies in this land, at all. Maybe
’tis something worse. But oh! The funny
little noises!”</p>

<p>“<i>What</i> noises, Katie?” begged Rob.</p>

<p>“Oh, the little whinin’ and sobbin’, like one
wantin’ to get out. ’Tis no rats live in the
owld well. Would <i>rats</i> be whimperin’ and
beggin’ like?”</p>

<p>“Begging, Katie!” cried Rob. “Oh, what
do they say? Please, please tell me quickly.”</p>

<p>“La, no! Master Rob,” said Katie, looking
sidewise at the little boy, “your Mamma
wouldn’t want me to be frightenin’ ye with
tales the likes o’ these.”</p>

<p>“But I’m not frightened, Katie,” said Rob
eagerly. “I’m just <i>interested</i>.”</p>

<p>“H’m,” said Katie doubtfully, glancing at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
the clock. “Whisht! Master Rob! ’Tis a
quarter to nine, and time for you to be startin’
for school, or you’ll be late.”</p>

<p>And indeed, Rob had to run all the way,
and reached school barely in time.</p>

<p>Rob’s papa did not forget to bring home a
rat-trap that night, and after dinner he said,—</p>

<p>“Now, Rob, I am going down cellar to set
the trap, and if you want to come with me I
will show you the old well.”</p>

<p>Of course Rob wanted to go. So Rob’s
papa took a lighted candle in one hand, and
the rat-trap nicely baited with cheese in the
other, and they descended the steep cellar
stairs together. It was very dark in the cellar,
and the candle made queer flares on the walls
and ceiling, and lighted up corners which Rob
had never before seen. In the very darkest
and dimmest corner of all, away in the back
cellar, Rob’s papa paused, and then Rob saw
that in the floor there was a trapdoor with an
iron ring, quite like the Arabian Nights!</p>

<p>“It is from somewhere hereabout that
Katie says she hears the noises,” said Papa.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
“We will set the trap on the floor, close beside
the wall, and I warrant we shall catch a big
rat before many nights are over.” So he set
the trap with the spring ready to catch the first
greedy rat who should try to steal the cheese.</p>

<p>“Now let us look into the well,” said Rob’s
papa. “I haven’t lifted this cover for years.
Ugh! It is heavy enough!” He tugged at
the iron ring and presently the cover flew back.
Down below yawned a great black hole, very
deep and seemingly quite empty.</p>

<p>“Here, Rob, take hold of my hand,” said
his papa, “and you can look down.” Rob
held tightly to his father’s hand, and bending
over, peered into the well. The candle which
his father held flickered and flamed and shot
a shaft of light down into the strange hole.</p>

<p>“I can’t see anything,” said Rob, disappointed.
“I don’t think there is any water
there. But—but I think I hear something!
A queer little noise like water trickling, or
somebody whispering very softly.”</p>

<p>“The spring may be bubbling yet,” said
his father. “Katie, O Katie!” he called upstairs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
“Please bring me a tin pail and a ball
of stout twine. We will see whether the Indian
spring has run dry or not.”</p>

<p>“The Saints preserve us!” Rob heard
Katie cry in the kitchen above, as she went
about to do as she was bid. And again Rob
thought he heard a murmuring in the well.</p>

<p>“There is the queer noise again, Papa!”
he cried. “It sounds like some one talking a
long way off.”</p>

<p>“Pooh, pooh!” said Papa. (He was always
saying, “Pooh, pooh” at Rob’s queer
notions.) “Run and get the pail and the
cord, Sonny. Katie is afraid to come near
the well. Ah! Now we shall soon know.”</p>

<p>He tied the cord to the handle of the pail,
while Rob held the candle and they watched
the pail descend. Down, down it went, until it
disappeared into the blackness. “Well, well!”
said his father. “Ten, twenty, I must have
paid out thirty feet of cord already. I had forgotten
that the well was so deep. Hello! There
was a splash; hear it, Rob?”</p>

<p>Rob heard,—a quick splash, and again the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
queer little noise, a tinkle, a trickle, a rustle,
a whisper.</p>

<p>“O Papa,” he cried, “let me draw up the
pail, please.”</p>

<p>“Well, be very careful, Son,” said his father.
And Rob began to pull on the cord, while
his father held tightly to his jacket so that he
should not fall down into the deep, black hole.
The pail was rather heavy. It bumped against
the sides of the well, tinkling and jingling as
it came up. Rob thought that it jerked and
wobbled strangely. But perhaps his hand was
not quite steady, he was so excited. At last
the pail came in sight, full of water. They
drew it over the edge, Rob stooping eagerly
to see. Filled to the brim it was, and running
over.</p>

<p>“Clear water, as cold as ice,” said Rob’s
Papa, dipping in his finger. “Let us take it
upstairs and see it in a better light. I would
not have believed that the old spring was still
bubbling.”</p>

<p>Very carefully Rob carried the pail of water
up the cellar stairs. “Katie, O Katie!” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
called. “See the water from the old well!
From thirty feet down in the darkness it
came.”</p>

<p>“The Saints preserve us!” cried Katie.
(She was always saying that.) “I wouldn’t
touch water from the witch-well for any money
ye could offer.”</p>

<p>“It is clear and bright as glass,” said Rob’s
papa.</p>

<p>“O Papa! Let me drink some,” cried Rob.
“I should so love to taste water from a real
Indian spring.”</p>

<p>“O Mr. Evans! Don’t let the b’y taste
it!” begged Katie, clasping her hands. “It
will kill him, the p’isen water!”</p>

<p>“No, Rob,” said Mr. Evans, “I think
Katie is right. It might be dangerous to drink
the water. But it looks delicious. What a
pity that we cannot use spring water from
our own ancestral well, instead of buying it
at the store as every one else must!”</p>

<p>“Please, Papa—just one little sip?”
begged Rob.</p>

<p>“No, not one little sip, Son. Here, Katie,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
empty the pail of water into the sink,” said
Mr. Evans firmly.</p>

<p>Tremblingly Katie took the pail and went
with it to the sink. But she had not turned
half the water away when she gave a scream.</p>

<p>“Ow! The whimperin’ and cryin’! Hark
till it!” she shrieked. And indeed, it seemed
to Rob that the water sobbed and moaned as
it ran down the sink spout. Suddenly he had
an idea.</p>

<p>“It is too bad to let the beautiful fresh
Indian spring water run into the horrid old
sewer,” he said. “Please, Papa, come with me
and let me pour it back into the well.”</p>

<p>“Pooh, pooh!” laughed Mr. Evans. “What
an idea! You are as silly as Katie, Rob. I
don’t want you to get strange ideas into your
head. But—well, come along, since you are
so anxious that the famous water should not
be wasted. I want to cover up the well tightly,
so that no one can fall in.”</p>

<p>Downstairs they went once more, Rob carrying
the pail half full of water, which he poured
back into the well. With a glad <i>splash</i> it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
joined the hidden spring far, far below, and
again Rob felt sure that he caught the sound
of a whispering voice, tinkling, trickling, sighing,
sobbing, as if it were trying to say something
to him, perhaps to thank him. He bent
over the well, listening eagerly. But his father
pulled him back by the hand.</p>

<p>“Come, Rob,” he said. “I want to put the
cover in place, and then we must go upstairs.
It is time that you were in bed.”</p>

<p>So they let down the cover with a <i>bang!</i>
and Rob went away with his father out of
the dark cellar and into the gaslight. But the
sound of those queer little noises followed
after him, upstairs and upstairs, and even after
he was in bed.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>The queer little sounds followed Rob upstairs,
and even after he was in bed he could
hear them echoing from far below in the cellar.
At first they were only little trickly
sounds, like water <i>seekling</i> afar off. But by
and by, when the house was very still, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
everybody except Rob had fallen sound asleep,
the noises grew louder and plainer. They grew
into a soft murmur, sometimes a sob, sometimes
the whisper of a little silver voice. And
at the same time there was a gentle knocking.
Rob listened and listened as hard as ever he
could, and he said to himself,—</p>

<p>“Surely, Katie is right. There is something
strange about the cellar, and I think it comes
from the old well. What can it be?”</p>

<p>Finally the voice sounded so loud and so
plain that Rob could hear distinctly what it
was saying, and it seemed to be talking to him.</p>

<p>“Let me out; ah, let me out!” cried the
silvery, trickly voice, and again Rob heard
the knocking. “Good little boy, you who
would not let the water of the Indian spring
be wasted, come and free me from my prison
of so many years.”</p>

<p>A prisoner! Some one was shut up in the
old well! Rob sat up in bed. He must set
the prisoner free. He was not a bit frightened
at the thought of going down all alone into
the cellar, for he knew that there was nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
more to be afraid of in the dark than in the
daylight. He got up and thrust his feet into
a pair of slippers and put on his bath robe.
Then very softly, so as not to waken anybody
in the house, he crept downstairs: down to
the floor where his father and mother slept,—he
could hear them breathing as he passed the
door; down past the library where the books
lived and all night long told silent stories to
one another in the moonlight; down to the
empty dining-room, and through to the kitchen.
Here Rob found a candle on a shelf and lighted
it. Then, taking this in one hand and holding
up his trailing bath robe with the other, he
stole down the cellar stairs. The voice was calling
now louder than ever, and with it sounded
the knocking, which certainly came from the
old well.</p>

<p>“Let me out, O kind boy!” sobbed the silvery,
tinkling voice. “Let me out. Oh! I
thought I was free to-day, but alas! Here I
remain yet a prisoner, for how many more long
years? O kind little boy, the first one to do
me a good turn, let me out, let me out!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>Rob hastened to the corner in which was
the old well. And as he drew near, the voice
became plainer and plainer, and the knockings
louder and louder. He set the candle down on
the floor beside the rat-trap which his father
had baited that afternoon, and his heart beat
fast as he bent over the cover of the well and
seized the iron ring in both hands. Should he
be able to lift it?</p>

<p>One—two—three! Rob strained hard,
but the cover would not budge. One—two—three,
again! It was so heavy for a little
boy to lift. One—two—three! Once more!
Rob felt the cover move a tiny bit. The
noises down in the well had ceased suddenly.
It was very still. Rob could hear his heart
thumping like the screw of a steamboat.
Now, for one last time! One—two—<i>three</i>!
The cover came up suddenly, so suddenly that
Rob nearly went over backward. There below
yawned the great black hole of the well.</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Rob, drawing a long breath.</p>

<p>“<i>Oh!</i>” Was it an echo, or a soft little
voice, far, far below?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>Rob took up the candle and peered down
into the well. But he could see nothing. “Is
any one down there?” he asked. At first there
was no answer, and then there came a tinkly,
trickly sound like water bubbling, which
turned at last into a whispered “<i>Yes!</i>” There
certainly was some one in the old well!</p>

<p>“Who are you?” said Rob, tingling all
over with excitement.</p>

<p>“Oh, little friend, kind boy,” said the voice,
“I am the Fairy of the Indian spring, shut
up here for years and years, unable to get out.
I have called and called, but you are the first
who has come to aid me.”</p>

<p>“What can I do to help you?” asked Rob
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Let down the bucket as you did this afternoon,”
said the voice. “Let down the bucket
and draw me up.”</p>

<p>The pail with the ball of twine lay close beside
the well, where Rob’s papa had forgotten
it that afternoon. Rob set the candle down on
the floor and began to lower the pail into the
well. Yard after yard after yard the hungry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
throat swallowed the cord. Finally he heard
the pail splash as it reached the water. He
waited a moment. The pail bobbed about and
then grew heavy on the cord. Then the silver
voice cried, “Draw up, draw up, kind boy!”</p>

<p>Rob pulled on the cord eagerly,—pulled
and pulled without looking down into the
well, until the pail tinkled against the bricks
of the cellar floor. In the flare of the candle-light
Rob saw that it was full of water. But
that was not all! Standing with feet braced
across the top of the pail, clinging to the
cord, was the strangest little figure about
six inches high; a little figure dressed all
in brown, with black hair and bright eyes.
When the pail rested on the cellar floor he
leaped off and stood before Rob, bowing,
with one hand laid upon his head.</p>

<p>And then Rob saw that it was a tiny Indian.
His brown dress was soft like deerskin, and
his leggings were fringed. His limp black hair
fell over a face of red-bronze, with high cheek-bones
and pouting lips. In his hair he wore
a tiny blue feather, perhaps from a blue jay’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
wing, and in his hands he carried the sweetest
little toy bow, while a quiver of inch-long
arrows hung on his shoulders. His feet were
covered with moccasins, and he was the exact
copy of a Wild West Indian; only he looked
like one seen through the wrong end of an
opera-glass.</p>

<p>“Oh—you must be an Indian Fairy,”
cried Rob, with his eyes bulging.</p>

<p>“Yes, Friend,” said the tiny one. “I am
an Indian Fairy, the Fairy of the Indian spring.
And you have brought me up for the second
time this day, though you did not see me the
first time. This is the second time during fifty
years that I have left the well. Ah, must I
go back again?” Despite the warlike appearance
of the little man his silvery voice began
to tremble.</p>

<p>“Tell me all about it,” said Rob soothingly.</p>

<p>“I am the Fairy who lived by the spring
years, and years, and years ago, before the
White Men came to Shawmut,” said the Fairy.</p>

<p>“What is Shawmut?” asked Rob, wondering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>“Shawmut is the Indian name of this place,”
said the Fairy. “It means the Place of Springs,
and it was so named because of the many
bubbling springs on the hillside above the
river. Oh! there were many, many of us. I
had dozens of brothers. But my spring was in
the fairest spot. This water was the sweetest
and clearest of any. Heigho! How often the
great braves used to kneel here for a refreshing
draught when they returned from the hunt
or from war! They never saw me, for I hid in
the moss about the spring. But I loved to look
at them, they were so big and wonderful.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what did they look like?” asked Rob
eagerly, for Rob loved to hear about Indians.</p>

<p>“They dressed as I do,” said the Fairy.
“But sometimes their faces were painted
green or red or blue. And I could see no
good in that. Sometimes they wore tassels of
hair at their belts. Ugh! I did not like that
fashion. Sometimes their hands were red,
and when they went away the waters of my
spring were stained. Ugh! Neither did I like
that. But they were brave and strong and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
noble. I loved the Red Men, for they lived
out of doors in the sweet sunlight, as I did.
They loved the fresh air and the blue sky and
the green grass. They would have no stifling
roof over their heads to shut out the sky; no
four walls to keep off the fresh air. Ugh! I
cannot breathe in a house. I stifle! I choke!”</p>

<p>“Then how did you come to be shut up in
this house?” asked Rob, wondering very much.</p>

<p>“Listen. The White Men came to Shawmut;
White Men with cows and dogs, women
and children. They built houses on the Hill,
near the bubbling springs, and planted corn.
They drove away the Red Men, and I loved
them not, for they were different. They wore
ugly dark garments, hats and short cropped
hair. They lived in close wigwams, and cared
nothing for fresh air and blue sky. Neither
did they love the trees, but cut them down to
burn, and mowed the flowers for their ugly
ploughed fields. The woods and the streams
meant nothing to them but places wherein
they might hunt and fish, which they did
gloomily. For they were solemn folk and sad.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
They thought it wicked to laugh merrily, as
the brook laughs, or to smile like the flowers.
Even the little children dared not be too gay,
but were afraid of their fathers!”</p>

<p>“That must have been a horrid time for
children,” said Rob.</p>

<p>“Alas! It was indeed a sad time for everybody,”
went on the Fairy. “The brave Red
Men were gone. Even the rabbits and squirrels
were gone. The Hill was peopled with
solemn and ugly folk, who dared not be
happy, and it was no longer beautiful as before.
Yet I could not go away and leave my
spring, my dear spring, which ran sweet and
clear as ever. It was the favorite fountain of
the Puritans, and crouching down under the
moss and ferns I watched them come and go,
gloomily, filling their buckets and pitchers.
But I loved them not, and I hoped that the
Red Men would come back and drive them
away. But the Red Men never came again.”</p>

<p>“And what happened next?” asked Rob,
much interested.</p>

<p>“Years went by, and the Hill became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
crowded with the White Men’s ugly wigwams.
The springs still bubbled, but it was a sad
song that they sang, for everything was
changed. But that was not the worst. Came
a day when a man built a house over my very
spring! He shut in the bubbling water under
a roof, between four ugly walls, where the
blue sky could no longer shine upon it nor
the fresh air visit it freely! Alas! Would
that I had escaped before then. I might have
gone earlier, though it would have been sorrowful
to desert my lonely spring. But I had
not guessed what was about to happen until
it was too late. I had not thought that even a
White Man could be so cruel as to wall up a
living spring. I was asleep under the moss
and ferns when they raised the roof over me.
Alas! I did not even waken at the sound of
their wicked hammers. But when I opened
my eyes it was too late. There was a screen
between me and the sky!”</p>

<p>“Why did you not run away?” asked Rob
sympathetically.</p>

<p>“Oh, you do not understand,” answered the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
Fairy with a sad little smile. “I might have
escaped at any time before the roof covered
me. But as soon as there was a roof above my
head, and four walls rose around me, I was
under the magic spell of the White Men. I
could not go away, even though the doors and
windows were yet yawning holes. I must remain,
even as the well must remain, until some
one should take pity on me and set me free.”</p>

<p>“And could you find no one to do that in
all those years?” cried Rob.</p>

<p>“Alas! No. The people who lived in the
house were dull folk who did not believe in
Fairies. For many years and many years I
have remained shut up in the darkness of this
cellar, pining in the deserted well. It is quite
useless and forgotten. Long ago the ferns and
mosses died, and I have no green thing left
to love, nothing beautiful to see.”</p>

<p>“Poor Fairy!” said Rob, and the tears
stood in his eyes.</p>

<p>“I have cried, I have called, I have knocked
on the walls of the well,” said the Fairy,
“but no one has seemed to hear my voice.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
Or if folk heard they have not understood.
Years ago some one who stepped as you step,
whose voice sounded like yours—I never saw
his face—used to come sometimes and listen
at the well, and I heard him wish and wonder.
But that was all.”</p>

<p>“It must have been my father!” exclaimed
Rob, remembering what had been said at the
breakfast table.</p>

<p>“But he could not understand what I tried
to tell him,” went on the Fairy. “He wondered
and walked about, but he always went
away without doing anything. It was as if I
spoke a foreign language. But you see I do
not. You understand me quite well, is it not
so?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” cried Rob. “And yet it is very
strange. It is not language such as others
speak. It is like trickling water that makes
words.”</p>

<p>The Fairy laughed. “It is not language at
all,” he said. “But you know it. There were
women, too; women with loud voices and a
curious twist to their tongues. They heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
my voice, some of them seemed even to understand
what I cried. For I heard them exclaim
and wonder and talk of the Fairy Folk. The
first time that this happened I was hopeful.
Surely, I said to myself, they know the Fairies.
They say that they come from a Green Land
where many Fairies live. Surely, surely they
will love the Little Men of another country.
They will understand why I long for green
grass and blue sky and fresh air. They will
help me to escape. But no! They were cowards.
They screamed and fainted when I spoke
from the old well. They must have had wicked
hearts, for they feared the Fairies. They dared
not come near, but complained to the master
and mistress, and would not live in the same
house with me.”</p>

<p>“Silly things!” said Rob. “Katie was one
of them.”</p>

<p>“So to please them the well was covered,”
sighed the Fairy, “and then it was worse than
ever. Think how dark, how lonely, how ugly
a home it was for an Indian Fairy who loved
the free, open life of outdoors! Oh, for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
green woods, the sunshine and blue sky! The
song of birds and the odor of flowers! Oh, to
feel the soft green moss, and taste the dew
fresh in the morning! Please let me out, kind
boy, that I may know those joys again!”</p>

<p>“Dear Fairy,” said Rob hesitatingly, “I
am so sorry, but to find all these things, save
the sky and air, one must now seek far from
here. The White Men have driven them away,
just as they drove the Indians, the squirrels,
and the rabbits. There is no green grass, there
are no flowers, no moss, no ferns on all the
Hill.”</p>

<p>“What do you tell me!” cried the Fairy.
“My Hill is no longer beautiful?”</p>

<p>“It is beautiful,” said Rob. “At least, the
White Men call it so. But the wigwams are
thick and very tall, shutting out the sunlight
from the paths between. And these paths are
dusty, hard streets, with neither grass nor trees
nor flowers.”</p>

<p>“Oh, why do White Men try so hard to
make the world ugly?” wailed the poor Indian
Fairy. “How can they live away from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
the woods and the flowers and the beautiful,
beautiful green grass! Where shall I go?
What shall I do?”</p>

<p>Rob thought and wondered, and thought
again. And at last he had an idea. “There
is a green country not so very far from here,”
he said. “One goes there in an electric car,—but
you don’t know what a car is. Never mind.
I went there yesterday and brought away some
beautiful ferns, growing in the mossy earth.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that I might see them!” cried the
Fairy eagerly. “One sniff of leafy mould, one
breath of the woods lingering about the tufted
moss! To lie once more in the shadow of a
fern and feel its freshness on my face! Where
is this woodsy wonder?”</p>

<p>“It is upstairs in my bedroom,” answered
Rob. “Will you come with me?”</p>

<p>The Fairy hesitated, looked at the pail of
water resting beside the well, and brightened
with a sudden thought.</p>

<p>“Yes!” he cried. “I know what may be
done. You can set me free, kind boy, you
only, of all the folk who have come to the Indian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
spring since the Red Men left it. The
spell which binds me to the spring and chains
me beneath the roof can only be broken when
the water is set free again to mother earth.
Yesterday I came near to being emptied into
the horrible sewer. You heard my cry as the
first of the water was lost. You saved me.
For had the pail been emptied then I must
have followed. And to what a fate!”</p>

<p>“It empties at last into the ocean,” said
Rob.</p>

<p>“And that would have been the end of me,”
shivered the Fairy. “Salt water is the one
thing which would destroy me utterly. But
come now. I know how I may be freed. Take
the pail of water and bring me with it to the
blessed clump of ferns.”</p>

<p>Rob agreed; he took up the candle in one
hand and the pail of water in the other.
Lightly as a bird the Fairy sprang upon the
rim of the pail, clinging to the cord. And so
they went together up out of the cellar, through
the empty kitchen and dining-room; very
softly up the stairs, past the library of silent-talking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span> 
books; up and up, very, <i>very</i> creepily
past the bedroom door ajar, whence Rob heard
the sound of his father and mother snoring
peacefully; up and up and up, tiptoeing so
as not to wake Katie, to Rob’s own chamber.
And there on the window-seat stood a big
flower-pot with the beautiful ferns which the
day before Rob had dug up in the woods.
The Fairy smelled them as soon as he entered
the room.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he cried, laying both little hands on
his breast, “How good that is! Dear boy,
empty the water quickly from the pail into the
earth brought from the woods, and I shall be
free to lie under my dear ferns once more.”</p>

<p>Rob emptied the pail into the flower-pot.
And as the last drop of water trickled from
the bucket, with a glad cry that sounded like
the tiniest of Indian war-whoops, the Fairy
leaped into the moist little dell which the
ferns made, and curled up against one of the
stalks, hugging it lovingly.</p>

<p>“Dear fern!” he cried. “Dear woodsy
fern! How sweet you smell. Dear moss, how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
soft you are! Dear fragrant earth, made of
dead leaves and all the ripe finished things of
the forest! Oh, I am myself once more. Dear
boy, you have made me very happy.”</p>

<p>“And you will live here with me in my
chamber, always and always, dear Fairy?”
begged Rob eagerly. “That will be so good!
I shall be happy indeed to have you for my
little neighbor. And I will never, never tell
any one about you, nor let them disturb your
green home.”</p>

<p>The Fairy looked at Rob and sighed.
“Little friend,” he said, “I love you dearly.
I would gladly make you happy. But I have
yet one more thing to ask of you. Think of
it! Even now I am shut under a White Man’s
roof,—I, an Indian Fairy! So many years
in a foreign wigwam, walled in a dark, skyless
well! Oh! Let me go back to the green
wood. Let me be free once more like the
rabbits and the squirrels. Will you set me
free, even though it means that you will never
see me again?”</p>

<p>Rob looked at the Fairy and his lip trembled.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
“I hoped”—he began. But he took
a long breath and said to himself, “I will not
be selfish. I will be kind and do as I would
be done by.” Then he spoke aloud. “Tell me
how I may set you free, dear Fairy, and I will
do it.”</p>

<p>“Ah, my kind friend!” cried the Fairy, “I
knew you would be generous! This, then,
you shall do for me. I will sleep to-night in
your chamber, and to-morrow, when the sun
is high, you shall take up the ferns out of the
flower-pot, these ferns all moist with the water
of the Indian spring. You shall take them up,
and me with them,—though you will not see
me after daylight,—and carry them to the
woods whence you took them. And when you
set them back in the ground of the forest
where they grew, then I shall be free, free,
free! Oh, dear boy, will you do this for me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will do this for you,” said Rob
gravely.</p>

<p>“Thanks, thanks!” cried the Fairy. “And
now, the night is almost done. I think I
feel the daylight coming. You will see me no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
more. But I shall be sleeping soundly under
the fern. And do you likewise go to rest in
your little bed. Look! You are shivering with
cold! But to-morrow do not forget your
promise.”</p>

<p>“I will not forget,” said Rob, feeling indeed
very cold and shivery. He crept away to
his little bed, and was soon sound asleep, warm
and comfy.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>It was late when Rob woke the next morning.
At first he thought that the adventure
with the Indian Fairy must have been a dream.
But as soon as he sat up in bed he saw the tin
pail on the floor beside the window-seat, and
the fern moist and green in the flower-pot.
So he knew that it must all have been true.
But he could not see the Fairy himself, though
he knew that the little fellow must be snugly
curled up under the green fronds of the fern.</p>

<p>When he came down to the breakfast table
his father and mother were talking earnestly
about something.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>“It is a wonder he wasn’t killed!” said his
Mamma, shuddering. “Why did you ever
show him that dreadful well?”</p>

<p>“I shall have the cover screwed down,”
said Mr. Evans. “It really isn’t safe. Hello,
Son! You walked in your sleep again last
night, did you know it? I suppose you don’t
remember. But Mamma found one of your
slippers outside the library door this morning,
and Katie found the other on the cellar stairs.
And Rob! <i>The cover of the old well was
open!</i> However did you lift it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t remember how I lifted it,” said
Rob, quite truthfully, and he looked dazed.</p>

<p>“Well, we can’t have this, you know,” said
his father. “I shall have to lock your door
every night. But we will have that old well
screwed up hereafter. Perhaps that will satisfy
Katie, though I think she will not be troubled
with any more noises in the wall. She says
that there was a big, big rat dead in the trap
this morning.”</p>

<p>And indeed, nobody ever heard any more
noises in the cellar after Rob helped the Indian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
Fairy to escape. That very morning, right
after breakfast,—for it was a Saturday and
there was no school,—he dug up the ferns
which he had planted in his flower-pot, and put
them in a little basket with the earth around
their roots. Then he started to take the electric
car which would carry him out of town to
the woods.</p>

<p>“Where are you going, Rob?” asked his
Mamma, seeing him with cap in hand.</p>

<p>“I am going to take my ferns back to the
woods,” Rob answered. “I think it is cruel
to keep things that love the sunshine and the
fresh air shut up in a house. I am sure that
the ferns would much rather be back in the
woods, don’t you think so, Mamma?”</p>

<p>“Well, I am sure I never thought of that!”
said his Mamma. “But you may go if you
will be back in time for dinner.”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131-132]</span>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i131.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">ROB AND THE INDIAN FAIRY</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So Rob took the ferns to the woods and set
them back in their first home under a big
gray rock, the prettiest little spot in the world
for a Fairy to dwell! But he saw nothing
more of the Indian Fairy, though he looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
and looked; and after he had started for home,
went back there again three separate times to
look, because he hated to part from his little
new friend. But the last time he heard, or
thought he heard, a very tiny, far-off, trickly
voice say,—</p>

<p>“Farewell, my friend! Farewell! I am free,
free, free! And you shall always be happy
when you come to the woods, even if you
never see me. For I will make this charm
about you, because you were kind. Farewell,
farewell!”</p>

<p>And this was the last that Rob ever heard
of the Indian Fairy, though he went often
and often to that same place in the woods; but
the Fairy charm did indeed prove true, and
Rob was always very, very happy as soon as
he came into the woods, happier than he was
anywhere else.</p>
